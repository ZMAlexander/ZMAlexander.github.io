            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>In New Caledonia, an archipelago located in the Pacific, south of the Equator, the climate is tropical, influenced by the trade winds, with a hot and rainy season, a cool and drier season, and two intermediate periods. - The hot season, humid and rainy, runs from late December to late March. In this season the temperatures are high, around 30/32 °C (86/90 °F) during the day, but with peaks of 35 °C (95 °F). The humid heat is felt, although the breezes make it less unpleasant; rain showers and thunderstorms are frequent. Rainfall is more abundant in inland elevations and in the north-eastern coast of the main island, where it exceeds 300 millimetres (12 inches) in the wettest month (March), while on the west coast it ranges from 200 mm (8 in) in the north, to 150 mm (6 in) in the south (see Nouméa). In addition, in this period the country can be hit by tropical cyclones (see below). However, even in this period, between heavy showers, the sun shines. - A cool season, and with little rainfall, from June to August or September, during which average highs drop to around 23/24 °C (73/75 °F), and lows to 17/18 °C (63/64 °F), which in themselves would still be acceptable temperatures, but sometimes they can drop below, in fact there can be some days with maximum temperatures around 20 °C (68 °F), furthermore, the wind can increase the feeling of coolness. Some showers can occur even in this period, most likely along the northern coast of the main island (see Poindimié), where the proximity of mountain slopes enhances the formation of thunderclouds. - Two intermediate seasons, April-May and October-November, in which the temperatures are acceptable, around 26/27 °C (79/81 °F) during the day, while rainfall is acceptable in the latter period, and a bit higher in the former one, especially in April and in the rainiest areas. </p>

            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>The land, sea, forest and mountains make up the natural diversity New Caledonia, so you can enjoy environments that are as different as they are thrilling. And rightly so! Comfortably nestled in the middle of the South Pacific, this archipelago remains a one-of-a-kind, a combination of rare and conserved natural areas. </p>

            <p>
                In northern Grande Terre, unusual geological formations offer every visitor a fascinating spectacle. Black, jagged cliffs fall into the ocean, the Brooding Hen watches the horizon, the Sphinx is also attentive, and the Lying Man remains peaceful. The shapes formed by the rocks over the millennia can be discovered on foot, by car or kayak will delight your eyes. </p>

            <p>
                Among the natural splendors of New Caledonia, mangroves are also some the world’s most unique discoveries. Take a simple walk to observe how they work and their ecological richness, or a land or air excursion so you can admire the famous Heart of Voh, immortalized by Yann Arthus-Bertrand. The nature here is fragile, shifting and moving. </p>

            <p>
                After crossing and sailing the seas, sailors never failed to be impressed by the creations of nature in the middle of the vast ocean. The small sandy island that has hosted the Amédée lighthouse since 1865 combines all the wonders of nature: gorgeous seascapes teeming with fish, a sparkling beach with white sand reflecting the sunlight, the possibility to swim, dive, splash around and perhaps run into a curious turtle. This is a break in nature right next to the city. </p>

            <p>
                In the Blue River Provincial Park or the Giant Ferns park, paths lead visitors/hikers into the heart of vegetation inherited over the millennia far from any civilization. Rare and protected species can now be admired on walks of any skill level and only ask to be quietly enjoyed by careful visitors. </p>

            <p>
                Nature in the Great South offers an incomparable playground to marvel at incredible natural sites. Between the red earth, which is as arid as it is rich in ore, the sparse vegetation fighting for survival and protected species in the water, from the lake of Yaté to the Madeleine waterfalls, you just need to keep your eyes open and you feel like you’re visiting another world.</p>

            <h2>Nouméa</h2>
            <p>Nouméa (French pronunciation: ​[nume.a]) is the capital and largest city of the French special collectivity of New Caledonia. It is situated on a peninsula in the south of New Caledonia's main island, Grande Terre, and is home to the majority of the island's European, Polynesian (Wallisians, Futunians, Tahitians), Indonesian, and Vietnamese populations, as well as many Melanesians, Ni-Vanuatu and Kanaks who work in one of the South Pacific's most industrialised cities. The city lies on a protected deepwater harbour which serves as the chief port for New Caledonia. At the August 2014 census, there were 179,509 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Greater Nouméa (French: agglomération du Grand Nouméa), 99,926 of whom lived in the city (commune) of Nouméa proper.[2] 66.8% of the population of New Caledonia live in Greater Nouméa, which covers the communes of Nouméa, Le Mont-Dore, Dumbéa and Païta.</p>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>While the size of New Caledonian lagoon invites you to explore and appreciate the mysteries and natural splendor of the sea, the New Caledonian archipelago also calls for you to discover its land! Put on your walking shoes and a comfortable outfit and get ready to explore a region of the world that is still partly unexplored.</p>
            <p>
                On the paths of the Gouaro Deva natural reserve, between the century old majestic trees of the , in the twists and turns of the Giant Ferns Park, climbing the slope of Mont Panié in the Northern Province, the highest peak of New Caledonia with its 1629 meters… Every walk or hike that you might want to take will offer you moments of intense joy, unexpected encounters with surprised Cagous or plants that do not exist anywhere else in the world. Take a walk and be enriched.</p>

            <p>
                If you leave the freshness of the forest, other magical hikes also await you as you walk in equally majestic surroundings. On the island of Maré, accompanied by a guide, climb the peaks of Shabadran. Difficult but one where effort is greatly rewarded with of the most beautiful views of the ocean and untamed nature in existence.</p>

            <p>
                Other more accessible hikes also offer amazing rewards. In the town of Sarraméa, paths with various levels of difficulty allow everyone, to climb and enjoy the superb landscapes of this region. Experienced hikers can reach the plateau of Dogny at an elevation of 1010 meters. Several hours is needed but the reward is worth it: the unforgettable view of the Valley of Sarraméa, the Bay of Bourail, and the Bay of Canala.</p>

            <p>
                In both the north and the south, the paths for long hikes have been developed over time. Trail marks and rest stops mark the different stages. The GR NC1 trail crosses the South Province, starting in the southern edge of New Caledonia in Prony. Seven stages allow you to explore the red soil of the Great South region, cross beautiful, luxuriant forests, and finally reach the dam of the Dumbéa River.</p>

            <h2>Swimming</h2>
            <p>Did you know that New Caledonia is home to 4 of the 7 species of turtles? Two of them can very easily be seen while swimming in the bays, lagoon and around popular islands. You will also see that some love humans. So much so that when they hear the sound of a boat, they come to the surface to greet us. I’m not joking. You have high chances to swim with turtles almost everywhere in New Caledonia, especially if you do snorkeling excursions around the reef. They tend to stay very close to Noumea and around the Loyalty Islands too.</p>
