          <p class="card-text">A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-     spewing and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that features in the       myths of many cultures around world. The two most well-known cultural traditions   of dragon are:

            The European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies. Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, and are uniquely six-limbed (four legs and a separate set of wings).
            The Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries.[1] Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence, and are quadrupeds (four legs and wingless).
            The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The English word dragon and Latin word draco derive from Greek δράκων (drákōn), "dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake".</p>
