  <p>I am an alert and friendly dog looking for a home. In my old home there was a mom and a child
  aged 5 years old. I can sit and am fully house trained. I love any activity that includes
  running, playing and being outside.</p>

  <p>I am a pretty female dog looking for my forever family. I have lived with men and women. I am
  very, very playful, smart and quick to learn new things. I can sit, stay, come and lie down. I
  love to be outside playing, especially at this time of the year.</p>
